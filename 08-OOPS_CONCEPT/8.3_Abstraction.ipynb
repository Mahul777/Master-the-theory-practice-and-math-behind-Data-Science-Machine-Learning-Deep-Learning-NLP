    "âœ… What is Abstraction?\n",
    "â€¢\tAbstraction means hiding complex details of an object and showing only the necessary features.\n",
    "â€¢\tIt helps reduce complexity and makes the code easier to work with.\n",
    "â€¢\tReal-world example:\n",
    "o\tA washing machine: You just press a button to start the wash or set the timer, but you donâ€™t need to know how the machine works internally.\n",
    "o\tMobile phones and remotes: You see the buttons and use the features, but the internal processes (like how an app is launched or a device shuts down) are hidden.\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ How Abstraction Works in Python:\n",
    "â€¢\tAbstract classes are used to define features but leave details to child classes.\n",
    "â€¢\tAbstract methods are like empty placeholders â€” child classes must fill them in with their own specific details.\n"
