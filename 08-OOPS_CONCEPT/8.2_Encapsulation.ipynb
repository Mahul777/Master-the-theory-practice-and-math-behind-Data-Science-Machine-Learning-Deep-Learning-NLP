    "\n",
    "Public: The name attribute is accessible directly from outside the class.\n",
    "Protected: The _gender attribute is protected. While it can be accessed by subclasses (like in Employee), it should generally not be modified or accessed directly outside the class.\n",
    "Private: The __age attribute is private. It cannot be accessed directly outside the class, but Python uses name mangling (i.e., _Person__age) to access private attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name Mangling:\n",
    "When you declare a private attribute (e.g., __age), Python internally changes its name to _Person__age to prevent direct access. This is called \"name mangling.\"\n",
    "Although this allows accessing the private attribute using p._Person__age, it's not the intended use, and it's typically discouraged because it breaks encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance:\n",
    "The Employee class inherits from Person. It can access the name attribute directly, and the protected _gender attribute can be accessed within the subclass.\n",
    "The print_gender() method in Employee prints the protected _gender attribute."
